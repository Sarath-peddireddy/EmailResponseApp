# Email Analysis and Reply App ðŸš€

### Overview

This project demonstrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating email-related tasks. Built using Streamlit, LangChain, Cohere, and Pydantic, the app provides an intuitive interface to analyze and respond to emails effectively.

With just an email inputâ€”either via pasted content or a URLâ€”the app performs the following:

Detects the language of the email.
Translates it to English if necessary.
Summarizes the email into four concise bullet points.
Generates a polite and professional reply based on the context.

### Key Features

Email Language Detection: Automatically identifies the email's language.

Translation: Ensures that all emails are translated into English for easier processing.

Summarization: Generates a concise, four-bullet summary to save time.

Automated Reply: Crafts a professional response, saving the user from composing replies manually.

### Technologies Used

Streamlit: To create an interactive web application.

LangChain: For prompt engineering and seamless LLM integration.

Cohere: LLM used to power the email analysis and response generation.

Pydantic: Ensures structured and validated output from the LLM.
